Some bits and bobs I made for a Garry's Mod DarkRP server themed around HL2RP because I was bored.

The scripts only work for DarkRP but you could change it for other gamemodes pretty easily... At that point you may as well just remake them better.

Please note that I am terrible at lua and I am still trying to learn it so don't expect the contents to be good, just thought some people might find some of it useful.

A lot of this lua was from things I have learned instead of being scripted off the top of my head so I'm sure its clunky.

You WILL have to edit things to work for you.

I tried to add comments in places to make it easy to understand.
